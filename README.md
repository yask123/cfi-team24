#Route Optimization for multiple stops

A web-app which will provide navigation for multiple stops using the optimal route.

### Why google maps navigation?

Because it's the best in class, with automatic route rerouting, traffic management, shows broken roads, etc. Why re-invent the wheel? The links open in the Google maps application, so no issues there.
